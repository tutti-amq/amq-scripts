# AMQ scripts
#### For now there is only one script: Anime shortcuts
What it does:
- show best shortcut(-s) for an anime after the song plays

Which shortcuts are considered "best"
- shortcut is considered best if it shows anime as 1st in dropdown (that means some shortcuts are ugly, but they do the work)
- while calculating shortcuts I only included the ones of shortest length (e.g if anime has at least one 3 symbol shortcut I wouldn't bother with 4 symbol ones)

#### Disclaimer:
I do not own full database of anime names used in AMQ (that mostly concerns short/alt names that are not considered englishName or romajiName), so results of my calculations aren't 100% correct, but I'd say that 98% of times shortcuts are indeed correct.
<br>
<br>Remaining 2% include:
- alt/short anime name that I did not encounter while playing and filling database
- new anime that have not been included while generating latest shortcuts file
- some changed/removed names affecting results of shortcuts generation
